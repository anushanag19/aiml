It is a test to determine that if a machine can think like a human or not. According to this test, a computer can only be said to be intelligent if it can mimic human responses under some particular conditions.
In this test, three players are involved, the first player is a computer, the second player is a human responder, and the third player is the human interrogator, and the interrogator needs to find which response is from the machine on the basis of questions and answers.","The Turing test, named after Alan Turing, is a method of testing a machine's human-level intelligence. For example, in a human-versus-machine scenario, a judge will be tasked with identifying which terminal was occupied by a human and which was occupied by a computer based on individual performance.

Whenever a computer can pass off as a human, it's deemed intelligent. The game has since evolved, but the premise remains the same.",,,60

AIML_1028,What is game theory and it's important in AI,"Game theory is the logical and scientific study that forms a model of the possible interactions between two or more rational players. Here rational means that each player thinks that others are just as rational and have the same level of knowledge and understanding. In the game theory, players deal with the given set of options in a multi-agent situation, it means the choice of one player affects the choice of the other or opponent players.
Game theory and AI are much related and useful to each other. In AI, the game theory is widely used to enable some of the key capabilities required in the multi-agent environment, in which multiple agents try to interact with each other to achieve a goal.
Different popular games such as Poker, Chess, etc., are the logical games with the specified rules. To play these games online or digitally, such as on Mobile, laptop, etc., one has to create algorithms for such games. And these algorithms are applied with the help of artificial intelligence.","Game theory, developed by American mathematician Josh Nash, is essential to AI because it plays an underlying role in how these smart algorithms improve over time.

At its most basic, AI is about algorithms that are deployed to find solutions to problems. Game theory is about players in opposition trying to achieve specific goals. As most aspects of life are about competition, game theory has many meaningful real-world applications.
These problems tend to be dynamic. Some game theory problems are natural candidates for AI algorithms. So, whenever game theory is applied, multiple AI agents that interact with each other will only care about utility to itself.

AIML_1030,What are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors,"Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are the two main concepts of Linear algebra.
Eigenvectors are unit vectors that have a magnitude equal to 1.0.
Eigenvalues are the coefficients that are applied to the eigenvectors, or these are the magnitude by which the eigenvector is scaled.","The directions along which a particular linear transformation compresses, flips, or stretches is called eigenvalue. Eigenvectors are used to understand these linear transformations.

For example, to make better sense of the covariance of the covariance matrix, the eigenvector will help identify the direction in which the covariances are going. The eigenvalues will express the importance of each feature.

State: It is the situation that is returned by the environment to the agent.
Reward: The feedback received to the agent after doing each action.
In RL, the agent interacts with the environment in order to explore it by doing some actions. On each action, the state of agent gets changed or sometimes remains the same, and based on the type of action, and he gets a reward.

Gain and lift charts: Gain & Lift charts are used to determine the rank ordering of the probabilities.
AUC-ROC curve: The AUC-ROC is another performance metric. The ROC is the plot between the sensitivity.
Gini Coefficient: It is used in the classification problems, also known as the Gini Index. It determines the inequality between the values of variables. The high value of the Gini represents a good model.
Root mean squared error: It is one of the most popular metrics used for the evaluation of the regression model. It works by assuming that errors are unbiased and have a normal distribution.
Cross-Validation: It is another popular technique for evaluating the performance of the machine learning model. In this, the models are trained on subsets of the input data and evaluated on the complementary subset of the data.","We have to first split the data set into training and test sets.

It takes the current state of the agent as its input and produces the estimation of how close the agent is from the goal. The heuristic method, however, might not always give the best solution, but it guaranteed to find a good solution in a reasonable time. Heuristic function estimates how close a state is to the goal. It is represented by h(n), and it calculates the cost of an optimal path between the pair of states. The value of the heuristic function is always positive.

Admissibility of the heuristic function is given as:

AIML_1048,What's a feature vector?,"A feature vector is an n-dimensional vector that contains essential information that describes the characteristics of an object. For example, it can be an object's numerical features or a list of numbers taken from the output of a neural network layer.

A data set is usually organized into multiple examples where each example will have several features. However, a feature vector won't have the same feature for numerous examples. Instead, each example will correspond to one feature vector that will contain all the numerical values for that example object.

Feature vectors are often stacked into a design matrix. In this scenario, each row will be a feature vector for one example. Each column will feature all the examples that correspond to that particular feature. This means that it will be like a matrix, but with just one row and multiple columns (or a single column and multiple rows) like [1,2,3,5,6,3,2,0].",,,,60
AIML_1049,What's selection bias? What other types of biases could you encounter during sampling?,"When you're dealing with a non-random sample, selection bias will occur due to flaws in the selection process. This happens when a subset of the data is consistently excluded because of a particular attribute. This exclusion will distort results and influence the statistical significance of the test.

Other types of biases include survivorship bias and undercoverage bias. It's important to always consider and reduce such biases because you'll want your smart algorithms to make accurate predictions based on the data.",,,,60

AIML_1052,How would you go about choosing an algorithm to solve a business problem?,"First, you have to develop a problem statement that's based on the problem provided by the business. This step is essential because it'll help ensure that you fully understand the type of problem and the input and the output of the problem you want to solve.
The problem statement should be simple and no more than a single sentence. For example, let's consider enterprise spam that requires an algorithm to identify it.
The problem statement would be: Is the email fake/spam or not? In this scenario, the identification of whether it's fake/spam will be the output.
Once you have defined the problem statement, you have to identify the appropriate algorithm from the following:

Any classification algorithm
Any clustering algorithm
Any regression algorithm
Any recommendation algorithm
Which algorithm you use will depend on the specific problem you're trying to solve. In this scenario, you can move forward with a clustering algorithm and choose a k-means algorithm to achieve your goal of filtering spam from the email system.
While examples aren't always necessary when answering questions about artificial intelligence, sometimes it will help make it easier for you to get your point across.",,,,60
AIML_1053,When is it necessary to update an algorithm?,You should update an algorithm when the underlying data source has been changed or whenever there's a case of non-stationarity. The algorithm should also be updated when you want the model to evolve as data streams through the infrastructure.,,,,60
AIML_1054,What's regularization?,"When you have underfitting or overfitting issues in a statistical model, you can use the regularization technique to resolve it. Regularization techniques like LASSO help penalize some model parameters if they are likely to lead to overfitting.

There are other methods that can be used to avoid overfitting, you can mention cross-validation techniques such as k-folds cross-validation.

Another approach is to keep the model simple by taking into account fewer variables and parameters. Doing this helps remove some of the noise in the training data.",,,,60
AIML_1055,"What's the difference between inductive, deductive, and abductive learning?","Inductive learning describes smart algorithms that learn from a set of instances to draw conclusions. In statistical ML, k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine are good examples of inductive learning.
There are three literals in (top-down) inductive learning:
Arithmetic literals
Equality and inequality
Predicates

In deductive learning, the smart algorithms draw conclusions by following a truth-generating structure (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion) and then improve them based on previous decisions. In this scenario, the ML algorithm engages in deductive reasoning using a decision tree.

Abductive learning is a DL technique where conclusions are made based on various instances. With this approach, inductive reasoning is applied to causal relationships in deep neural networks.",,,,60
AIML_1056,What would you do if data in a data set were missing or corrupted?,"Whenever data is missing or corrupted, you either replace it with another value or drop those rows and columns altogether. In Pandas, both isNull() and dropNA() are handy tools to find missing or corrupted data and drop those values. You can also use the fillna() method to fill the invalid values in a placeholder - for example, 0.",,,,60
AIML_1057,What's the trade-off between bias and variance?,"Bias is error due to erroneous or overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm you're using. This can lead to the model underfitting your data, making it hard for it to have high predictive accuracy and for you to generalize your knowledge from the training set to the test set.
Variance is error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm you're using. This leads to the algorithm being highly sensitive to high degrees of variation in your training data, which can lead your model to overfit the data. You'll be carrying too much noise from your training data for your model to be very useful for your test data.

The bias-variance decomposition essentially decomposes the learning error from any algorithm by adding the bias, the variance and a bit of irreducible error due to noise in the underlying dataset. Essentially, if you make the model more complex and add more variables, you'll lose bias but gain some variance in order to get the optimally reduced amount of error, you'll have to tradeoff bias and variance. You don't want either high bias or high variance in your model.",,,,60
AIML_1058,What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?,"Supervised learning requires training labeled data. For example, in order to do classification (a supervised learning task), you'll need to first label the data you'll use to train the model to classify data into your labeled groups. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, does not require labeling data explicitly.",,,,60
AIML_1059,How is KNN different from k-means clustering?,"K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised classification algorithm, while k-means clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm. While the mechanisms may seem similar at first, what this really means is that in order for K-Nearest Neighbors to work, you need labeled data you want to classify an unlabeled point into (thus the nearest neighbor part). K-means clustering requires only a set of unlabeled points and a threshold: the algorithm will take unlabeled points and gradually learn how to cluster them into groups by computing the mean of the distance between different points.

The critical difference here is that KNN needs labeled points and is thus supervised learning, while k-means doesn't and is thus unsupervised learning.",,,,60
AIML_1060,Explain how a ROC curve works.,The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the contrast between true positive rates and the false positive rate at various thresholds. It's often used as a proxy for the trade-off between the sensitivity of the model (true positives) vs the fall-out or the probability it will trigger a false alarm (false positives).,,,,60
AIML_1061,Define precision and recall.,"Recall is also known as the true positive rate: the amount of positives your model claims compared to the actual number of positives there are throughout the data. Precision is also known as the positive predictive value, and it is a measure of the amount of accurate positives your model claims compared to the number of positives it actually claims. It can be easier to think of recall and precision in the context of a case where you've predicted that there were 10 apples and 5 oranges in a case of 10 apples. You'd have perfect recall (there are actually 10 apples, and you predicted there would be 10) but 66.7% precision because out of the 15 events you predicted, only 10 (the apples) are correct.",,,,60
AIML_1062,What is Bayes' Theorem? How is it useful in a machine learning context?,"Bayes' Theorem gives you the posterior probability of an event given what is known as prior knowledge.

Mathematically, it's expressed as the true positive rate of a condition sample divided by the sum of the false positive rate of the population and the true positive rate of a condition.
Bayes' Theorem is the basis behind a branch of machine learning that most notably includes the Naive Bayes classifier. That's something important to consider when you're faced with machine learning interview questions.",,,,60
AIML_1063,Why is Naive Bayes naive?,"Despite its practical applications, especially in text mining, Naive Bayes is considered Naive because it makes an assumption that is virtually impossible to see in real-life data: the conditional probability is calculated as the pure product of the individual probabilities of components. This implies the absolute independence of features - a condition probably never met in real life.

To put it whimsically, a Naive Bayes classifier that figured out that you liked pickles and ice cream would probably naively recommend you a pickle ice cream.",,,,60
AIML_1064,Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization.,"L2 regularization tends to spread error among all the terms, while L1 is more binary/sparse, with many variables either being assigned a 1 or 0 in weighting. L1 corresponds to setting a Laplacean prior on the terms, while L2 corresponds to a Gaussian prior.",,,,60
AIML_1065,What's the difference between Type I and Type II error?,"Type I error is a false positive, while Type II error is a false negative. Briefly stated, Type I error means claiming something has happened when it hasn't, while Type II error means that you claim nothing is happening when in fact something is.

A clever way to think about this is to think of Type I error as telling a man he is pregnant, while Type II error means you tell a pregnant woman she isn't carrying a baby.",,,,60
AIML_1066,What's a Fourier transform?,"A Fourier transform is a generic method to decompose generic functions into a superposition of symmetric functions. The Fourier transform finds the set of cycle speeds, amplitudes, and phases to match any time signal. A Fourier transform converts a signal from time to frequency domain - it's a very common way to extract features from audio signals or other time series such as sensor data.",,,,60
AIML_1067,What's the difference between a generative and discriminative model?,A generative model will learn categories of data while a discriminative model will simply learn the distinction between different categories of data. Discriminative models will generally outperform generative models on classification tasks.,,,,60
AIML_1068,How is a decision tree pruned?,"Pruning is what happens in decision trees when branches that have weak predictive power are removed in order to reduce the complexity of the model and increase the predictive accuracy of a decision tree model. Pruning can happen bottom-up and top-down, with approaches such as reduced error pruning and cost complexity pruning.

Reduced error pruning is perhaps the simplest version: replace each node. If it doesn't decrease predictive accuracy, keep it pruned. While simple, this heuristic actually comes pretty close to an approach that would optimize for maximum accuracy.",,,,60
AIML_1069,What's the kernel trick and how is it useful?,"The Kernel trick involves kernel functions that can enable in higher-dimension spaces without explicitly calculating the coordinates of points within that dimension: instead, kernel functions compute the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in a feature space. This allows them the very useful attribute of calculating the coordinates of higher dimensions while being computationally cheaper than the explicit calculation of said coordinates. Many algorithms can be expressed in terms of inner products. Using the kernel trick enables us effectively run algorithms in a high-dimensional space with lower-dimensional data.",,,,60
